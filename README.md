## Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide tools for calibrating and preprocessing images captured by hyperspectral SWIR and RGB cameras. Proper calibration and preprocessing are essential for accurate data analysis and image alignment.

## Features
- Image preprocessing for hyperspectral SWIR and RGB cameras
- Camera calibration routines
- Data collection tools
- Image alignment algorithms

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Use the provided scripts to collect images from both cameras.
2. **Calibration**: Run the calibration routines to calibrate the cameras.
3. **Preprocessing**: Apply preprocessing steps to the collected images.
4. **Image Alignment**: Use the alignment algorithms to align images from both cameras.
